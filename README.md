## What is cocos2d-js ?

cocos2d is a family of game engines for different platforms and written in different languages, the share the same features.

But cocos2d-js is NOT just another cocos2d engine. Instead it is a package... a collection of different components and engines tailored for iOS, Android and Web game development; using Javascript as their development language. The package includes:

  * [cocos2d-x](http://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) (game engine for iOS and Android)
  * [Chipmunk](https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk-Physics) (physics engine for iOS and Android)
  * [JavaScript](http://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) bindings for cocos2d-x
  * [CocosPlayer] (for testing) 
  * [CocosBuilder](http://github.com/cocos2d/CocosBuilder) (Visual editor)
  * [cocos2d-html5](http://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5) (game engine for Web Browsers)
  * [Chipmunk-JS](http://github.com/https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js) (physics engine for Web Browsers)

...with an installer (althought the installer is not ready yet).
